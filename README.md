# ConsoleCapitalist
"Console Capitalist is my first amateur game made in the terminal. The goal of the game is to buy out Elon Musk, that is to earn 300 billion $."
The controls in the game are very simple - to start the game, just hold down the enter key for a short while.
Once the game has started, you can buy investments using the numbers on the keyboard from 1 to 9, and 0 represents the number 10. 
Pressing the esc key exits the game and saves your progress. 
To win the game, you must have 300 billion $ and click 'E'.
